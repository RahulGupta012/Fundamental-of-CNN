There are some pooling layers for downsampling the image.This pooling helps to show the clear image to the filter.The leter portion of the CNN, where the dense layer are existed is simple ANN.These layers are called 'Fully connected layers' In which there are a softmax activation function applied in the output layer, which is the last layer of the CNN."

Then the chances of overfitting will high as CNN is designed for complex problems.The computetional cost also will high to apply CNN in this dataset as compere to applying the Ann.The one another disadvantage of using CNN for this dataset is that, CNN is made for RGB images which are 3d in  such dataset which has grayscaled image can simply be dealt by  ANN."
